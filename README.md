# Lunar Lander Controller for Espruino

This piece of code will make a physical controller with four touch sensors powered by a Espruino microcontroller (I am using the [Pico)](http://www.espruino.com/Pico) act as the arrow keys from a keyboard to play online games (this was made with the [Lunar Lander](http://moonlander.seb.ly/) in mind). This project was the first assignment for Tom Igoe's Tangible Interaction Workshop at the Interactive Communications Program at NYU-Tisch offered during the Spring 2018 term. 

## Index
This repository contains the following: 

- Testing code for the touch sensor
- A program for the controller using the [USB Keyboard Module](http://www.espruino.com/modules/USBKeyboard.js). 

*Note: the easiest way to program a Espruino Microcontroller is using the [Web IDE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/espruino-web-ide/bleoifhkdalbjfbobjackfdifdneehpo) from the Chrome Web Store*

## Hardware 
- 5 Catalex capacitive touch sensor (code adapted from [Henry's Bench](http://henrysbench.capnfatz.com/henrys-bench/arduino-sensors-and-input/catalex-ttp223b-arduino-capacitive-touch-sensor-tutorial/) sample code for Arduino). 
- A Espruino Pico board
