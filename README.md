# Lunar Lander Controller for Espruino

This piece of code will make a physical controller with four touch sensors powered by a Espruino microcontroller (I am using the [Pico)](http://www.espruino.com/Pico) act as the arrow keys to play online games. This was designed as the first assignment for Tom Igoe's Tangible Interaction Workshop at the Interactive Communications Program at NYU-Tisch. 

# Index
This repository contains the following: 

- Testing code for the touch sensor
- A program for the controller using the [USB Keyboard Module](http://www.espruino.com/modules/USBKeyboard.js). 

*Note: the easiest way to program a Espruino Microcontroller is using the [Web IDE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/espruino-web-ide/bleoifhkdalbjfbobjackfdifdneehpo) from the Chrome Web Store*
